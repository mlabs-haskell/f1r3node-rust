# F1R3node Rust

Pure Rust implementation of the F1R3FLY blockchain node.

This repository tracks the Rust node implementation that lives on `rust/dev` in the upstream `f1r3node` repository and documents it as a standalone Cargo workspace. Local development uses standard Rust tooling and native system packages only.

## Overview

F1R3node Rust provides:

- Concurrent smart contract execution with Rholang and RSpace
- Proof-of-stake consensus and finalization via the `casper` crate
- gRPC and HTTP APIs for deploys, proposals, status, and data queries
- Docker and local standalone workflows for development and testing

## Workspace Crates

| Crate | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `node` | Main binary, CLI, API servers, REPL, diagnostics |
| `casper` | Consensus engine, block processing, genesis, finalization |
| `rholang` | Interpreter and CLI for Rholang contracts |
| `rspace++` | Tuple space storage and state management |
| `models` | Protobuf models, generated gRPC types, schema helpers |
| `crypto` | Keys, signatures, hashes, TLS certificate helpers |
| `comm` | P2P networking, peer discovery, TLS transport |
| `block-storage` | Block, deploy, DAG, and finality persistence |
| `shared` | Common storage traits, event helpers, metrics utilities |
| `graphz` | Graph and DOT generation helpers |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

macOS:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
brew install protobuf openssl pkg-config lmdb just grpcurl
```

Ubuntu or Debian:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev pkg-config libssl-dev liblmdb-dev build-essential gcc
cargo install just
```

The workspace is pinned to `nightly-2026-02-09` in `rust-toolchain.toml`.

### (Optional) PeTTa (for the `rho:petta:execute` system service)

The `rho:petta:execute` system service runs MeTTa code through
[PeTTa](https://github.com/trueagi-io/PeTTa) (a MeTTa interpreter written in
SWI-Prolog). When running the node locally (outside Docker) you must make it
available on your system yourself.

The Docker image already includes it, so this step is only needed for local runs.

1. Install SWI-Prolog (`swipl`), version `9.3.x` or newer, **with the janus
   Python bridge**. PeTTa makes use of thir bridge, which
   only exists in recent SWI-Prolog builds — older interpreters fail at load time
   with `` source_sink `library(janus)' does not exist ``.

   > ⚠️ The `swi-prolog` package on Debian bookworm (and matching Ubuntu releases)
   > is **9.0.4**, which predates janus and will not work. Use a newer build from
   > one of the sources below. This is why the Docker image pulls SWI-Prolog from
   > the official `swipl` image instead of the distro package — see the
   > `swipl-extract` stage in [node/Dockerfile](node/Dockerfile).

   Ubuntu (SWI-Prolog stable PPA — ships a recent janus-capable build):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-add-repository ppa:swi-prolog/stable
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install swi-prolog
   ```

   macOS (Homebrew — recent versions include janus):
   ```bash
   brew install swi-prolog
   ```

   Any platform (no local install): run `swipl` from the official image, which is
   exactly what the node's Docker build uses:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it swipl:stable swipl --version
   ```

   Verify janus is available:
   ```bash
   swipl -g "use_module(library(janus)), halt" -t "halt(1)"
   ```
   The command should exit silently (status 0); an error means janus is missing.

2. Clone PeTTa somewhere on your machine and point `PETTA_PATH` at it. Using the
   same commit the Docker image pins keeps local behaviour in sync with the
   container (see `PETTA_REF` in [node/Dockerfile](node/Dockerfile)):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trueagi-io/PeTTa.git ~/PeTTa
   git -C ~/PeTTa checkout 52e85c6d02d016a4734559a64b2a69e8fdc385fc
   export PETTA_PATH=~/PeTTa
   ```

   Add the `export PETTA_PATH=...` line to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`,
   `~/.zshrc`, ...) so it persists across sessions. If `PETTA_PATH` is unset the
   node falls back to `./PeTTa` relative to the working directory, which no longer
   exists in the repository, so setting it explicitly is required.


### Git Hooks (Required)

The pre-commit and pre-push hooks gate every commit and every push. **Install them before your first commit:**

```bash
cargo install cargo-deny --locked   # one-time, required by the pre-commit deny step
./scripts/setup-hooks.sh            # points core.hooksPath at .githooks/
```

| Hook | When | Checks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pre-commit` | Every commit | `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`, `cargo deny check` |
| `pre-push` | Every push | `cargo clippy` (re-check), `cargo test --release` (per-crate) |

Both hooks auto-skip in CI environments (the same gates run server-side in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

**Mandatory for all contributors:**

- All three pre-commit checks (fmt, clippy, deny) must pass.
- The pre-push test suite must pass.
- Do **not** use `git commit --no-verify` or `git push --no-verify`. The same checks run in CI; bypassing locally only defers the failure.
- The `SKIP_FMT` / `SKIP_CLIPPY` / `SKIP_DENY` / `SKIP_TESTS` / `QUICK` / `TEST_CRATES` env-var skips are for local in-progress experimentation only — every commit and push that reaches the remote must pass without skips.

See [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md#git-hooks) for the full skip-flag reference and `setup-hooks.sh --status` / `--remove` management commands.

### Build

```bash
cargo build
cargo build --release
```

### Test

```bash
cargo test
cargo test --release
./scripts/run_rust_tests.sh
```

### Run A Local Standalone Node (without Docker)

[`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) is a command runner included in the prerequisites above.

```bash
just run-standalone           # build + run standalone node
just run-standalone-debug     # debug build (faster compile)
just clean-standalone         # reset to genesis
```

The node listens on `localhost` ports 40400-40405. See [`run-local/README.md`](run-local/README.md) for configuration details and manual startup without `just`.

### Run With Docker

```bash
# Standalone (single node, instant finalization)
docker compose -f docker/standalone.yml up

# Multi-validator shard (bootstrap + 3 validators + observer + Prometheus + Grafana)
docker compose -f docker/shard.yml up
```

See [`docker/README.md`](docker/README.md) for building local images, port map, validator setup, and monitoring.

#### Pull The Prebuilt Image

CI publishes multi-arch images (`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`) to Oracle Container Registry (OCIR) on pushes to `master`, on release tags, and on a nightly schedule. The repository is public — **no Oracle Cloud account or `docker login` is required** to pull.

```bash
docker pull sjc.ocir.io/axd0qezqa9z3/f1r3fly-rust:latest
```

Tag conventions:

| Tag | When it is published |
| --- | --- |
| `:latest` | Latest push to `master` |
| `:VERSION` (e.g. `:v0.4.12`) | Release tag push |
| `:nightly` / `:nightly-YYYYMMDD` | Nightly scheduled build |

Use a pulled image with the compose files by overriding `F1R3FLY_IMAGE`:

```bash
F1R3FLY_IMAGE=sjc.ocir.io/axd0qezqa9z3/f1r3fly-rust:latest \
    docker compose -f docker/standalone.yml up
```

To build a local image:

```bash
./node/docker-commands.sh build-local
```

## Default Ports

| Port | Service |
| --- | --- |
| `40400` | Protocol server |
| `40401` | External gRPC API |
| `40402` | Internal gRPC API |
| `40403` | HTTP API |

## Development Notes

- `.cargo/config.toml` sets `RUST_MIN_STACK=8388608` for deep Rholang recursion in tests.
- `node`, `models`, and `comm` use `build.rs` to generate gRPC and protobuf bindings.
- `rholang` and `rspace++` depend on the external `rholang-parser` crate fetched from Git.
